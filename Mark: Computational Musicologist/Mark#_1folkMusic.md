Mark#1
Persona
Mark

Pilot
TUNES

Goal
Mark is interested in understanding how Dutch folk tunes relate to other music, e.g. from French court operas.

Scenario
Starting from a collection of Dutch folk tunes, Mark attempts to relate these tunes to other documented music, using a variety of databases.  Mark would like to relate individual pieces of music, but also repertoires generally.  He would also like to understand musical evolution over time.

Competency questions
Can we identify a tune (e.g. from an oral tradition) in our collection with music in another documented collection, e.g. RISM, NEUMA, ABC

Can we compare music from different collections, e.g. from different countries to show connections/influences between musical styles?


Can we compare music longitudinally, e.g. to see evolution of tonality and transition from modal to tonal?  Working either at manuscript of collection level.
Can we visualize changes in musical form over time, e.g. transition from modal to tonal (evolution curves - see Weiss et al. 2018 ‘Investigating style evolution of Western classical music: A computational approach’) - with zooming

Can we visualize interconnections, e.g. of tunes which share melodic patterns or geographical origin?


Resources
Mark works with:

RISM catalogue of musical sources, composers etc https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu with the ability to search on names and music

NEUMA, a digital library of musical scores http://neuma.huma-num.fr/home/presentation 

ABC notation database http://abcnotation.com/ 

Database of Dutch tunes http://speelmuziek.liederenbank.nl/ - uses subset of lilyPond music engraving program http://lilypond.org/ 

Mark’s work could be helped by:

Connection to other databases, so that he could automatically query a range of databases
