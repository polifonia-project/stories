## Persona

Mark

## Pilot

ORGANS

## Goal

To be able to understand the relationships between historic Dutch organs, and to understand the trends in organ construction over time.

## Scenario

As part of his research Mark makes use of a search and exploration tool that provides access to a Knowledge Graph of a 15 volume collection of books describing Dutch organs.
Mark wants to find the oldest Dutch organ with a particular keyboard. He uses metadata search for the subset of organs that contain this keyboard and sorts them by date of construction. He reads about the oldest organ with that type of keyboard. One of the metadata fields describes the materials used to build the organ. He wonders if those materials were commonly used in the construction of organs featuring that keyboard	He visualises the set of organs according to the materials used in their construction. He notices that there are a number of differences in the materials used. He wonders whether the differences in material are associated with particular time periods	He visualises the set of organs according to both materials used and time of construction. He notices trends possibly related to the availability of materials and the migrancy of organ builders with skills in the use of certain materials. These questions lead him to further searches of the knowlege graph.

## Competency questions

Can we see interconnections between organs, e.g. same builder

Can we identify organs through a characteristic, e.g. oldest organ in the Netherlands with a keyboard to G3?

Can we ask technical questions about the construction of the organ and which materials were made?

Can we observe and understand trends in organs over time, e.g. how one tradition (German) influences or replaces another (Dutch) and why?

Can we visualize change of a network over time, e.g. with a slider, and do this in a way such as to see the change without having to remember previous states?

## Resources

Mark works with:

15 volume collection of books about Dutch organs; the text for which, but not the images, have been digitalised.

Markâ€™s work could be helped by:

Creation of knowledge graph, e.g. using NLP, from this book collection and other sources, e.g. magazines and books.

The ability to visualize networks changing over time, e.g. with a slider.
