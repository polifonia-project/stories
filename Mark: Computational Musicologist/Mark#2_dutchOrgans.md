## Persona

Mark

## Pilot

ORGANS

## Goal

To be able to understand the relationships between historic Dutch organs, and to understand the trends in organ construction over time.

## Scenario

Mark works with a 15 volume collection of books describing Dutch organs.  Currently the text is digitised, so the books are individually searchable by text search.

## Competency questions

Can we see interconnections between organs, e.g. same builder

Can we identify organs through a characteristic, e.g. oldest organ in the Netherlands with a keyboard to G3?

Can we ask technical questions about the construction of the organ and which materials were made?

Can we observe and understand trends in organs over time, e.g. how one tradition (German) influences or replaces another (Dutch) and why?

Can we visualize change of a network over time, e.g. with a slider, and do this in a way such as to see the change without having to remember previous states?

## Resources

Mark works with:

15 volume collection of books about Dutch organs; the text for which, but not the images, have been digitalised.

Mark’s work could be helped by:

Creation of knowledge graph, e.g. using NLP, from this book collection and other sources, e.g. magazines and books.

The ability to visualize networks changing over time, e.g. with a slider.
