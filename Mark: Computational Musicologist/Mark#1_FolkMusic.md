# Mark#1_FolkMusic

## Persona

Mark

## Goal

Mark is interested in understanding how Dutch folk tunes relate to other music, e.g. from French court operas.

## Scenario

Starting from a collection of Dutch folk tunes, Mark attempts to relate these tunes to other documented music, using a variety of databases.  Mark would like to relate individual pieces of music, but also repertoires generally.  He would also like to understand musical evolution and transmission over time.

## Competency questions

CQ1: Can we identify a tune (e.g. from an oral tradition) in our collection with music in another documented collection, e.g. RISM, NEUMA, ABC

CQ2: Can we trace the origin of a melody (composer)?

CQ2: Can we compare music from different collections, e.g. from different countries to show connections/influences between musical styles?

CQ3: Can we compare music longitudinally, e.g. to see evolution of tonality and transition from modal to tonal?  Working either at manuscript of collection level.

CQ4: Can we visualize changes in musical style over time, e.g. transition from modal to tonal (evolution curves - see Weiss et al. 2018 ‘Investigating style evolution of Western classical music: A computational approach’) - with zooming

CQ5: Can we visualize interconnections, e.g. of tunes which share melodic patterns or geographical origin?

CQ6: Can we link repertoires by scribes?

CQ7: Do 'national' repertoires have specific characteristics in terms of frequent patterns?

CQ8: How does translation (of lyrics) affect variation in the melody?

CQ9: Which aspects of melody vary and which remain stable in the process of transmission and adaptation?

CQ10: How did certain repertoires (e.g., Italian opera) circulate?

CQ11: What are the connections between printed sources and manuscripts? (manuscripts could be copies of printed sources)

## Resources

Mark works with:

RISM index of musical sources, composers etc https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu with the ability to search on names and music

NEUMA, a digital library of musical scores http://neuma.huma-num.fr/home/presentation 

ABC notation database http://abcnotation.com/ 

Database of Dutch tunes http://www.liederenban.nl and http://www.liederebank.nl/mtc

Mark’s work could be helped by:

Connection to other databases, so that he could automatically query a range of databases
