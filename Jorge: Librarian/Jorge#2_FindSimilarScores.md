# Jorge#1_OrganizeMyLibrary

## Persona
Jorge

## Goal
People interested in finding scores ask for some very specific criterias, such as for instance "I would like the list of Toccatas in D composed at Rome during tyhe 17 century". The resulting list is empty, or contains very few scores. The visitors are disapointed, and do not know how to find sth that suits their need.

## Scenario  

Jorge then uses a tool to propose similar work, close to the initial search. It might be the list of toccatas in Italy, or italian organ works in general, or toccatas written for the harpsichord, in a diffrent key signature, etc. Jorge can propose these similar scores to his visitors.  

The dashboard presents an overview of the classifying dimensions. Some of them might be hierarchical in nature (for instance the region/country/city classification). Whenever a dimension is chosen, the dashboard adapts to this new context by refining the classification of scores based on sub-dimensions.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: What criterias can be selectively relaxed from an initial search?

CQ2: What definitions of similarity are relevant for the various dimensions of a search?


## Resources
Jorge's work could be helped by tools that expand a search, relaxing criterias in a controlled way.
