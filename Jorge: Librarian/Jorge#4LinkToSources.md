# Jorge#4_LinkToSources

## Persona
Jorge

## Goal

Each Opus in Jorge's library features at least one score that gives a description, using music notation, of the Opus content. There exist other sources, often (but not always) that relate to the same Opus: scan of music scores (e.g., Gallica or IMSLP), textbooks or manuscripts, audio and video documents. 
Jorge would like to refer to these source in order to, for instance, be able to give its visitors a link to listen to a music piece, or obtain additional information on the Opus, its historical context, its dissemination.

## Scenario  

The user interface of Jorge's library shows mainly a rendering of the music score. It should be enriched with links that help to 
get a comprehensive list of textual, visual, audio or video sources. The visitor could then be invited to listen a part of the displayed score, 
or to look at a performance of the Opus by a specific artist.

Ideally, there would exist an alignment of score fragments at a given granularity (e.g., measures) and corresponding fragments in a source. For instance, all measure in a piano sonata would be aligned with a temporal inteerval in a performance. One can imagine that a parallel rendering of both representations would be possible, 
e.g.,  listening to the performance while highlighting at the same time the measure being played.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: describe sources related to a music Opus, and link such sources with an Opus in the digital library

CQ2: propose means to refer to *fragments* of a Opus, eg., the first 10 measures, or part B of a movement

CQ3: define links at a level of granularity finer than the document itself. For instance associate a fragment in an Opus with the corresponding region in a scan of an external score/source (e.g., a PDF in Gallica).
