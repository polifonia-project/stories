# Jorge#1_OrganizeMyLibrary

## Persona
Jorge

## Goal

Jorge manages a digital library of scores. He aims at describing each score with a rich set of contextual information, although a comprehensive descritpion is often ot possible. Among these information, one finds
  - The musical work (or 'Opus') this score belongs to. A score can cover a whole Opus (e.g., a symphony) or only a part of it (e.g., the third movement). Additionally, it can contain only some parts, all the parts, a trasnscription for non-original instruments, etc. Jorge wants to preserve each score at the appropriate level, with an adequate referencing (e.g., the official Opus number in a standard catalogue exists, K234.a, of BWV192, etc.)
  - Licence and copyright information 
  - An organisation in collections, clear and flexible
  - Tools to manage this organisation and search for relevant scores.
  

In terms of digital tools, Jorge wants a dashboard that gives him at a glance on overview of a score library content. The overview shows statistics on the library organized after the many dimensions that can be used to classify score: composer, period, countries/region/city, style, length, tonality, prominent patterns, orchestration, etc. 


## Scenario  

The dashboard presents an overview of the classifying dimensions. Some of them might be hierarchical in nature (for instance the region/country/city classification). Whenever a dimension is chosen, the dashboard adapts to this new context by refining the classification of scores based on sub-dimensions.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: What are the relevant dimensions to classify a digital library?

CQ2: Which dimensions can be extracted from the score itself as *patterns* qualifying the score?

CQ3: What are the most/less selective dimensions, and how do they vary in a specific context

## Resources
Jorge's work could be helped by tools that dynamically adapt the organization of a library based on needs expressed by the librarian.
