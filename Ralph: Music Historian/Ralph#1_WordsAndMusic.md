# Ralph#1_WordsAndMusic

## Persona

Ralph

## Goal

Ralph is particularly interested in matching text to music, e.g. in terms of emotions.

## Scenario

Ralph is developing a database of librettos.  He analyses these librettos to relate the words to music, in particular in how they create emotions.

## Competency questions

CQ1: Who is the poet (librettist) associated with a text?
CQ2: What is the emotion represented by a portion of text (~140 categories)?
CQ3: How do libretto and music relate, e.g. in describing an emotion?
CQ4: How does the presentation (text and music) of a work, e.g. an operatic aria, change over time, and depending on the artist?
CQ5: How have the music and libretto been influenced by the historical, e.g. social, political and cultural, environment?
CQ6: How can one describe and classify a scenario?
