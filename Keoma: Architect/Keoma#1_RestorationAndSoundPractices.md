# Keoma#1_RestorationAndSoundPractices

## Persona

Keoma is an architect and a restorer
## Goal 

Keoma needs to draw up a restoration plan for a belfry, without altering the immaterial context connected to traditional sound practices and the impact of the bell sound on traditional soundscape.
- sound practices
- restoration

## Scenario  

Keoma has to draw up a renovation plan for a bell tower damaged by the earthquake and wants to know what kind of interventions to implement on the wall structure. He needs to avoid the alteration of the characteristics of the bell chamber as a component of the production of the bells sound. Keoma therefore needs to know what kind of sound practices are performed in that bell tower. Keoma needs to know if sound practices are currently practiced and how often, and if those sound techniques involve humans and, if so, how many people are generally employed in the performance. Keoma must also understand if there are significant differences between the sound performed manually and the electrified one, in order to develop indications related to the impact on the soundscape in both cases. Keoma also needs to know if there are documents that proof to the diffusion of this sound in surrounding space back in time, in order to document any prescriptions that he will elaborate on a historical basis.
