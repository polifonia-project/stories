# Keoma#1_RestorationAndSoundPractices

## Persona

Keoma is an architect and a restorer

## Goal 

Keoma needs to find different types of information and data from different sources. His goal is to interconnect data between architectures and their use for sound performances, in order to proceed with protection actions.
- sound practices
- restoration

## Scenario  

Keoma has to elaborate a restructuring plan for various bell towers and wants to know what kind of interventions to implement on the wall structure respecting the characteristics related to the use of the bell cell as a component of the production of the sound of the bells, and respecting traditional local sound practices. 

Keoma therefore needs to know what kind of sound practices are performed in each bell tower, starting with the names of the Churches given in a list. 

Keoma begins to search for the location of each church, also to understand if it is an urban, peri-urban or rural context. 

Keoma needs to know if in each of the churches the practices of sound are currently practiced by moving the bells manually or electrically. 

Furthermore, for static calculations he needs to know with which mounting system each bell is attached, its weight, its measurements and the material it is made of. 

If the sound techniques involve human beings, Keoma needs to understand what kind of tools (ropes, pestels) are used in the production of the sound and how many people are generally employed in the performance. 

Keoma also needs to know if there are sound documents that testify to the musical performances carried out in the different bell towers, to document the use of the bells in different events. 

To do this, Keoma would have to resort to numerous searches: bibliographic sources, archival sources, field surveys and interviews with informed people. 

Thanks to Polifonia, Keoma can carry out these searches automatically, through a keyword search, retrieving a large amount of data in a short time. 

## Scenario  
The searched data can be divided into: Architectural data, Data related to the bells, Data related to sound practices, Data related to sound recordings, Bibliographic data.

**Architectural data**

The data related to each individual Italian church can be retrieved on the web from different sources, in particular Wikipedia, the General Catalog of Cultural Heritage, BeWeb, for example:

- The Church of San Pietro di Sturla is located in Carasco, Genova Province.  

- The Church was built in 1619 

- The Church is located in a periurban context

**Data relating to the bells**

The data relating to the bells can be searched on some websites of the sector such as Associazione Campanari Liguri, Associazione Italiana di Campanologia; in the specialized bibliography of which very few publications are online; in the General Catalog of Cultural Heritage. 
For example:

- The bells in the Church of San Pietro di Sturla are 5 (a “bell concert”) 

- The mounting system of the bells is the “falling clapper” (battaglio cadente) 

- The bells are all made of bronze and they were melted by Fonderia Regolo Capanni di Fidenza (PR) in 1929 

- The bells have different nominal notes: REb3, MI b3, FA3, SOL b3, LA b3. The extension of the whole concert is an “intervallo di quinta” 

- The bells have different weights (…), and measures (…) 

**Data relating to sound practices and musical features**

The data relating to the bells can be searched in specialized bibliography, of which very few publications are online. Data relating to the bells can be searched on some websites of the sector such as Associazione Italiana di Campanologia, Associazione Campanari Liguri etc, and in the general catalog of Cultural Heritage.
For example:

- All the bells of San Pietro di Sturla, according to their mounting system, can be played “a distesa” (bell moving about 30°), ”a bicchiere” (starting the movement with the bells upside down, at 180°),  “a campane ferme” (the bells are not moving, only the clappers will be moved, producing sound). 

- All the bells of San Pietro di Sturla are played both electrically and manually 

- When played manually “a campane ferme”, the bells are played by the use of “cordette” (small chains connected with the arms and the legs of the bell ringers), a “tastiera” (keybords) or manually moving the clappers. This characterizes the “sistema ligure”, toghether with other elements 

- Some repertoires/genres are tipically associated with specific events. 

- One genre is the “Salmo alla Romana” 

- The “Salmo alla Romana” is usually associated with the day of a “Festa Patronale”, or the day before the “Festa Patronale”.  

- Sometimes the repertoire of bell ringers includes pieces taken from contemporary music. The execution of such songs is not connected to any particular event, but it is performed by the bell ringers for exibition and fun. 

**Data relating to sound recordings**

Recordings data can be searched in some portals for example  Alphabetica and in Youtube, for audiovisuals containing bell concerts. 
For example:

- A concert played in San Pietro di Sturla for exhibition was recorded by ethnomusicologist Mauro Balma in 1994 

- The concert is divided in 6 different “sonate” 

- One sonata is a “Salmo alla Romana” 

- The Salmo alla Romana was performed by Armando Rocca 

- Another sonata is from a contemporary repertoire. It is called  “Marina” and it is taken from the song Marina Marina written by Rocco Granata in 1959

**Bibliographic data**

The Bibliographic data can be searched by keywords in : Opac, Alphabetica, campanology Websites 
For example: 

- The Sistema Ligure is described in the text “Campanari, campane e campanili di Liguria” By Mauro Balma, 1996
