# Frank#1_OrganKnowledge

## Goal 

Frank wants to learn more about other organs in the country.

## Scenario  

Frank regularly comes together with his friends from church. They want to plan a little weekend trip to the other side of the country and go to the church mass on Sunday in the city nearby where they are staying. To prepare for the visit, he wants to learn about the church and the organ. In general, Frank wants to find out more about the history of the church, but also what the similarities are between how the organs (the one he usually plays and the one he will listen to) sounds. For this, Frank is primarily interested in the disposition and who built the organ.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: Search organs with the possibility to combine searches, based on various features. (In this scenario: city, building, organ builder, disposition)

CQ2: Which organ builders worked on whose (original organ builderâ€™s) organs?

CQ3: Who built and/or renovated XX organ?

CQ4:What was the disposition of the organ at a specific point in time?

CQ5: Which organs have a similar disposition?

CQ6: What does the organ look like?

CQ7: What are the arthistorical features of the front of the organ? In which style is the organ built?

CQ8: What are the decorative elements?

CQ9: Which organs are built in a similar style?

## Resources

- Frank has some of the books from the Dutch organ encyclopaedia. He is also not too familiar with the contents of the books. Sometimes he scans through it looking for interesting facts, but does not know much about most organs that are mentioned in the books.
- When Frank wants to look up specific information, he always uses his standard search engine on his internet browser, unless he knows that the organ he wants to research is in one of the encyclopaedia editions he owns. On the internet, however, he cannot always find or access the information he wants.
