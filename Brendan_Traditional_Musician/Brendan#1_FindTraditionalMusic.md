# Find Traditional Music

## Goal 

Find suitably similar traditional music and historical context from northern European corpora.

## Scenario  

Brendan has received funding from the Arts Council of Ireland to create a new album of traditional music. He has an interest in combining European folk music with Irish music, and this is something that has informed both his academic and creative output. For this album, he would like to blend Irish tunes with tunes from Northern Europe. In order to do this, he first has to identify archives, performers, and recordings from these areas. He must then search for suitable pieces that would work with Irish tunes, in terms of time signatures, tempo, function, and tonality. This can be a time consuming task to search through multiple archives, and in languages that Brendan is not fluent in. If there was a portal to query and compare the similarity of know pieces of music against multiple different archives and regions, this would save time and potentially more fruitful results. Brendan then has to compile information on the history and authenticity of each tune in their context, which informs his performance practice, research interests, and the information available on the sleeve notes of his album. This knowledge will also be presented aurally at concerts and recitals.
