# Organize My Library

## Persona
Jorge

## Goal

Jorge manages a digital library of scores. He aims at describing each score with a rich set of contextual information, although a comprehensive descritpion is often ot possible. Among these information, one finds
  - The musical work (or 'Opus') this score belongs to. A score can cover a whole Opus (e.g., a symphony) or only a part of it (e.g., the third movement). Additionally, it can contain only some parts, all the parts, a trasnscription for non-original instruments, etc. Jorge wants to preserve each score at the appropriate level, with an adequate referencing (e.g., the official Opus number in a standard catalogue exists, K234.a, of BWV192, etc.)
  - Licence and copyright information 
  - Relations to standard external resources to refer to, e.g., composers or other kind of authorships
  - An organisation in collections, clear and flexible
  - Tools to manage this organisation and search for relevant scores.
  



## Scenario  

The dashboard presents an overview of the classifying dimensions. Some of them might be hierarchical in nature (for instance the region/country/city classification). Whenever a dimension is chosen, the dashboard adapts to this new context by refining the classification of scores based on sub-dimensions.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: Is there a digital space to represent and describe the concept of "Opus", and store digital scores related to an opus ?

CQ2: Is my collections and subcollections organisation based on clear concepts (e.g., genre, composer, period...) to gather Opuses ?

CQ3: Am I able to nagivate, search and visualize  my collections and opus ?

CQ4: Can I examine *features* extracted from  digital scores  (e.g., tonality, when relevant, number of parts, etc.) ?

CQ5: Identify the dimensions and/or features that are relevant to support an on-the-fly reorganization of the digital library, whenever the standard organization does not meet the user's expectations

CQ6: Can I progressively explore the content of my library, adding criteria to refine large results ? 

## Resources

In terms of digital tools, Jorge wants a dashboard that gives him at a glance on overview of a score library content. The overview shows statistics on the library organized after the many dimensions that can be used to classify score: composer, period, countries/region/city, style, length, tonality, prominent patterns, orchestration, etc.
