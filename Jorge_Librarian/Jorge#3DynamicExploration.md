# Jorge#3_DynamicExploration

## Persona
Jorge

## Goal
Jorge accesses to a part of the collection and is overwhelmed by the number of scores and their heterogeneity. Thus he expects the system to propose a set of means to refine the search, based on "facets" that partition the current result in a meaningful way.

## Scenario  

Instead of showing a list containing thousands of scores, the result is organized in groups, and each group is characterized by a distinctive property value. These group can be determined on the fly: if one accesses to the collection of a composer for instance, then relevant groups are the period of composition, the style, the genre, etc. If, instead, the initial access is on a genre, then grouping include composers. 

A nice feature would be to determine on the fly a partitioning of scores based on their salient patterns, if relevant.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: What are the most relevant dimensions to classify on the fly a result set ?

CQ2: What features can be extracted on the fly from a score content to partition in a meaning ful way a score collection?
