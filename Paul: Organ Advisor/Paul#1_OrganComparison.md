# Paul#1_OrganComparison

## Goal 

Successfully plan the restoration of an organ.

## Scenario  

Paul is hired to plan and supervise the restoration of an organ in a church. The church is from the sixteenth century. Paul would look up the organ in the Dutch organ encyclopaedia, which is ordered based on the year of production of the case of the organ. Because the organ is not necessarily made in the same year as the church, he first has to go through the indexes of the encyclopaedias in order to find the correct organ. Then, Paul searches for all organs that are made by the same organ builder. These organs are used as material for comparisons of the technical features. Finding and comparing the organs can be a tedious and time-consuming task. If this can be simplified and sped up by the use of the portal, Paul would save a lot of time and effort.
As it turns out, the comparison of the disposition indicates that the organ up for restoration has been changed significantly during a previous restoration. This is indicated by a large difference in base registers that is used in all organs by the same organ builder. Paul now has to go visit some of the other organs and the church archives in order to verify whether some of those registers were the original registers or not.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: Search organs with the possibility to combine search criteria, based on
- Location
    - City
    - Building/church name
- Organ builder
- Technical features, including, but not limited to:
    - Registers, and amount of registers
    - Number of keyboards
    - Range (klavieromvang)
    - Type of wind supply system
    - Pitch
    - Temperament
- Year of constructions
- Other people related to the organ (sculptor/carver, funder/donor)

CQ2: What are the technical features such as pitch, windpressure, and bellow type?

CQ3: What materials is the casing made of?

CQ4: What are the dispositions of all the organs made by XX organ builder?

CQ5: When have changes been made to the organ? What were these changes? Who made these changes?
