# Paul#2_ResourceReliability

## Goal 

Successfully plan the restoration of an organ.

## Scenario  

In this scenario Paul has to plan a similar restoration. However, from his already extensive knowledge about organs, he is uncertain about some of the information that was provided by the encyclopaedia. That is, some of the mentioned components and technicalities such as the pitch seemed illogical when compared to the other organs from the same organ builder. If it would somehow be possible to mark facts that are unreliable or untrue, that would save Paul a lot of time checking, verifying, and notating.

## Competency questions 

CQ6: Is XX fact reliable? What are the sources of XX fact?
