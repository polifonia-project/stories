# Identification Of Intangible Elements

## Persona

Patrizia is a Demo-Ethno-anthropologist Officer of the Ministry of Culture and she is responsible for the safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage pursuant to the 2003 Unesco Convention

## Goal 

Patrizia must propose safeguarding actions on some intangible practices related with bells sound. 

## Scenario  

She needs to know if the bells of some bell towers are involved in sound practices conducted by collective social actors who recognize those practices as constitutive trait of their collective identity. Patrizia starts her investigation from the denominations and the location of the bell towers. Patrizia checks whether the sound of those bell towers is done by hand or through electrification. Patrizia checks if there are more or less formalized and more or less recognized human groups that carry out those practices. Patrizia investigate what kind of transmission and apprenticeship methods are carried out: in what age groups, if exclusively male or even female, with what type of transmission (oral, written, formal or informal).

## Competency questions 

CQ1: Where is the Bell Tower?

CQ3: Are there formalized collective actors who carry out sound practices?

CQ4: Are there formalized transmission methods that characterize the acquisition of skills related to the bell practice?
