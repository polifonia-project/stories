# Frank#1_OrganKnowledge

## Goal 

Frank wants to learn more about other organs in the country.

## Scenario  

Frank regularly comes together with his friends from church. They want to plan a little weekend trip to the other side of the country and go to the church mass on Sunday in the city nearby where they are staying. To prepare for the visit, he wants to learn about the church and the organ. In general, Frank wants to find out more about the history of the church, but also what the similarities are between how the organs (the one he usually plays and the one he will listen to) sounds. For this, Frank is primarily interested in the disposition and who built the organ.

## Competency questions 

See story Paul#1_OrganComparison for retrieval CQs. In addition:

CQ1: What does the organ look like?

CQ2: Which organs are built in a similar style?

CQ3: What is the concert agenda for organ X?

CQ4: Where to find audio/video resources featuring organ X?

CQ5: Where to find audio/video resources featuring organist X?

CQ6: What is the address of the owner/maintainer of organ X?

## Resources

- Frank has some of the books from the Dutch organ encyclopaedia. He is also not too familiar with the contents of the books. Sometimes he scans through it looking for interesting facts, but does not know much about most organs that are mentioned in the books.
- When Frank wants to look up specific information, he always uses his standard search engine on his internet browser, unless he knows that the organ he wants to research is in one of the encyclopaedia editions he owns. On the internet, however, he cannot always find or access the information he wants.
