# Music Connections

## Persona
Keith

## Goal
Keith wants to compile programmes of music, e.g. for music festivals.  This involves putting together related pieces of music; in some cases the relationship may be non-obvious.

## Scenario
Keith uses music catalogues (see below), his own experiences of listening to music, and his intuition.

## Competency questions

CQ1: Can we find relations between different artists and music?

CQ2: Can we find music which has a non-obvious relation to some other music?

CQ3: Can we visualize the relations between different media, different music etc?

## Resources

Keith uses:

Music catalogues, e.g. https://www.discogs.com/ and https://bandcamp.com/

Radio channels, e.g. https://www.nts.live/

Google trends, to analyse how often an artists is searched for on the Web

Keith’s work could be helped by:

Technology to find connections between different artists, media, music, video etc; these connections might sometimes be non-obvious.

Technology to visualize these connections.
