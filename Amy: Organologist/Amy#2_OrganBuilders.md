# Amy#2_OrganBuilders

## Goal 

Amy wants to assess the developments of organ builders.

## Scenario  

This research includes looking into which organs an organ builder worked on and how their projects developed over time. This development can range from an increase of the size of the organ, to locality of their projects, or to the type or prestige of the project. The history section of the 15-part organ encyclopaedia is mostly used for this as this specifies year and changes that are made to the organs, but this obviously takes a lot of time and effort to research.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: Search organs with the possibility to combine searches, based on various features.

CQ7: Where can more information be found about a specific organ/organ builder/time period/location/etc.? / Which literature or resources contain information about a specific organ/organ builder/time period/location/etc.?

CQ8: Which organ builders worked on whose (original organ builder’s) organs?

## Resources

- Amy already has access to the physical as well as online library of the university where she works.
- Amy also has the entire 15 volume collection from the Dutch organ encyclopaedia. She uses the encyclopaedia mostly for reading about the arthistorical and technical aspects and developments of organs and comparing these to other organs.
- Database websites for information about organs and churches which all offer slightly different kinds of information:
  - https://www.kerk-en-orgel.nl 
  - https://reliwiki.nl/ 
  - http://www.orgbase.nl 
  - https://geoplaza.vu.nl/cms/research/kerkenkaart/ – Kerkenkaart (churchmap) from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
