# Amy#1_OrganTrends

## Goal 

For her next research project, Amy wants to discover artistic and technical trends of organs and how these developed. The development of these trends could possibly indicate wider social trends.

## Scenario  

During the project, Amy researches both artistic and technical trends surrounding organs in the Netherlands. Amy is interested in finding connections between different regions and time periods to see how the trends have developed. She also wants to put her findings in a historical and social context. Amy hopes that the knowledge graphs can help her identify initial trends. That way she knows where to dig deeper to understand the trends. In order to discover trends, comparisons similar to those needed by the organ advisor (Paul) are required. But besides the comparison of stops in organs made by the same organ builder, the comparisons can be related to almost every component of the organ. For example, the different arthistorical details on the fronts of the organs, or the wind supply system are interesting to compare.

## Competency questions 

See the set of CQs for Paul#1_OrganComparison. In addition:

CQ1: What are geographically distinct features of organs from region X? (e.g., in what differ 17th century Southern German organs from 17th century Spanish organs?).

## Resources

- Amy already has access to the physical as well as online library of the university where she works.
- Amy also has the entire 15 volume collection from the Dutch organ encyclopaedia. She uses the encyclopaedia mostly for reading about the arthistorical and technical aspects and developments of organs and comparing these to other organs.
- Database websites for information about organs and churches which all offer slightly different kinds of information:
  - https://www.kerk-en-orgel.nl 
  - https://reliwiki.nl/ 
  - http://www.orgbase.nl 
  - https://geoplaza.vu.nl/cms/research/kerkenkaart/ – Kerkenkaart (churchmap) from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
