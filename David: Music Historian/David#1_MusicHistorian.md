# David#1_MusicHistorian

## Persona
David

## Goal
David is interested in understanding the social history of music, e.g. who were the musicians, who was the audience, how did a particular musical environment relate to the wider musical environment.  He has a particular interest in understanding the environment around music which would not be classified as ‘elite’ music.  He is also interested in people’s experience of listening to music.

## Scenario  
David will work for several years collecting information, e.g. about brass bands, and populating a database with this information, as a preparation for writing a book.

## Competency questions 

CQ1: What music was being played?

CQ2: Who was listening to the music?

CQ3: How did the instruments used change over time?

CQ4: What was source of money – e.g. for instruments?

CQ5: Where were the musicians coming from?

CQ6: Who were teaching the musicians?

CQ7: Where were the places (in which they played)?

CQ8: How were instruments sold?

CQ9: What was the sales pitch?

CQ10: How does the world of brass bands connect with that of elite music?

CQ11: What did people ‘make of’, how  did they react to, e.g. music?

CQ12: Who was the author of a piece of music?
e.g. can we identify it by its incipit?

CQ13: What was the country of origin of a piece of music?

CQ14: What is the cause of a change, e.g. increasing number of concerts over time?


## Resources
David's work could be helped by:

sonic visualization, e.g. to recognise ‘thumbprints’ to identify the composer of a piece of music;

search of document database using RDF annotations and query-time reasoning;

NLP, e.g. to suggest relevant keywords for annotation; including using some semantics, e.g. proposing an annotation which does not occur in the text.
