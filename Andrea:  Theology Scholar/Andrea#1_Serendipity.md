# Andrea#1_Serendipity

## Persona
Andrea is a priest-scholar and a graduate music pianist with a specialization in organ music. 

## Goal
Andrea's goal is to discover and explore sacred music written from the period of the Renaissance through the twentieth century and its unexpected links with his scholarly studies.

## Scenario  
Andrea is been very busy studying ancient texts and history books and he would like to dedicate more time to his passion for music and organs. However, he doesn't actually know what to look for. He is fond of sacred music, classical music and organs and it would be cool for him if he could read curiosities about these topics or his favorite composers. And who knows, he might also find interesting and unexpected links to his scholarly studies without resorting to extensive study and research from many books of several libraries.
